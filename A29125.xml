         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29921:3"/>walk in the fear of God, and profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion, in which they are reall Practitioners, as their judgement leads them; but have been reall Engagers, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for the Parliament and Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> as is publiquely known: I am content to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a fool in Å¿ome mens eyes, in undertaking Å¿o great an encounter in Å¿uch deep Divinity, that hath troubled the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t and deepeÅ¿t judgements in all ages, and never as yet brought to a clear reÅ¿ult, but is Å¿till left doubtfull in all their writings, never obtaining an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aÅ¿Å¿ent, but many Å¿trange diÅ¿Å¿entings have ever appeared in all ages about theÅ¿e particulars.</p>
            <p>However, I for my part, being Å¿atisfied, both from Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, and clear Rationality in thoÅ¿e reÅ¿pects; and hoping in God that he will make me able to clear it up, and make it obvious to any rationall apprehenÅ¿ion, againÅ¿t any oppoÅ¿ition that can be held forth by theÅ¿e diÅ¿Å¿enting brethren; I have made thus bold, not only to oppoÅ¿e them, but have allÅ¿o preÅ¿umed to dedicate the Å¿ame to your Noble Excellency, in regard they have led me in Å¿uch preÅ¿umption: That Å¿o your Excellency, if time permit, might judge of the truth, as you find it to appear; and not Å¿o much as Å¿eem to patronize or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance any groÅ¿Å¿e errours, or abÅ¿urd tenents and expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, farre unÅ¿uitable for eminent ChriÅ¿tians; A brief Å¿urvey whereof your Excellency may find after the TreatiÅ¿e; the which, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, I earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ire your Excellency would read, when time will permit from your important buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, if you cannot find time to read the other, that Å¿o you might Å¿ee how farre it is poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible for a whole Church to erre, and that in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had not undertaken this encounter with you, if I had not been fortified with Å¿peciall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar notions and arguments, which you have not heard of from other men; and thoÅ¿e clearly deducible from Å¿acred Scripture. I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Å¿ome of your Brethren, from whom you diÅ¿Å¿ent, will approve Å¿ome things that I have held forth; neither yet doe I approve all that they hold againÅ¿t your doctrine, as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in divers Arguments, and ReaÅ¿ons rendred. I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire to hear from you either publickly, or in private, how you reÅ¿ent Å¿uch notions, and how you apprehend them; that if any thing be dark or doubtfull therein, I might clear it up, what my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, and what the truth is allÅ¿o, as I doubt not but to do in a Å¿hort Å¿pace by the help of God. I hope your principles are Å¿uch, not to deÅ¿piÅ¿e any rich treaÅ¿ure, becauÅ¿e of the veÅ¿Å¿ell that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it forth, but Å¿earch the Scriptures, whether theÅ¿e things be Å¿o. And beÅ¿ides, I doe conceive that it much troubleth you, that you cannot conceive how to reconcile your Brethrens doctrines with the Attributes of God, and therefore are forced to diÅ¿Å¿ent and Å¿eparate from them much againÅ¿t your wils: All which, if it be true, it may poÅ¿Å¿ibly cauÅ¿e you Å¿o to deny your Å¿elves, as to Å¿ubmit to the truth, when you Å¿ee it, and give glory unto God, who is the Truth it Å¿elf, and the only Fountain from whence it cometh, through what ever pipes it is conveyed unto you. I
<pb facs="tcp:29921:4"/>much doubt not but you will acknowledge, that God hideth things from the wiÅ¿e and prudent, that he revealeth unto babes; and that on purpoÅ¿e that no fleÅ¿h Å¿hould glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, but that he that glorieth might glory in the Lord. And leÅ¿t men Å¿hould Å¿ay, they have found out wiÅ¿edome; as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were too many for <hi>Gedeon,</hi> that the Lord Å¿hould deliver <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> into their hands, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould have Å¿aid, their own hands, and not the Lord, had Å¿aved them: So Å¿ome men are too wiÅ¿e to have knowledge given them of Å¿ome Å¿ecrets, leÅ¿t the people Å¿hould idolize the men, as having found them out by their own wiÅ¿edome, &amp; not give glory unto God; but he will not give his glory to another: And therefore wiÅ¿e men Å¿ometimes muÅ¿t be content to receive knowledge at the Å¿econd hand; and they are wiÅ¿e indeed, if they can be content to receive it from fools, yea from baÅ¿e things, in repute of the world, and mean, &amp; contemptible; and Å¿o they Å¿ometimes muÅ¿t, or elÅ¿e be without. But I need not inform you of theÅ¿e things, Å¿ave only to put you in remembrance: I therefore break off, and commit you to God, who is able to lead us into all truth, and to reveal unto us even his whole counÅ¿ell, and work us up, through faith and love, to faithfull obedience, and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to his will, and to make us perfect in every good word and work; Which the Lord grant both to you and me in his due time. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>Now the ApoÅ¿tles argument lyeth thus, to wit, If God Å¿pared not his only Å¿on, but delivered him up for us all, that are Gods elect, verÅ¿e 32. How Å¿hall he not with him alÅ¿o freely give us all things. Implying an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility but that he Å¿hould with him give us all things needfull both for our Å¿ouls and bodies; and make all things work together for our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29921:5"/>good, as verÅ¿e 28. Å¿o that God himÅ¿elf being for us nothing can be againÅ¿t us, verÅ¿e 31.</p>
            <p>So that the very reading of the text will Å¿atisfy any rational apprehenÅ¿ion, that the drift of the ApoÅ¿tle is to build them up to a Å¿trong confidence; that Å¿o they might have Å¿trong conÅ¿olati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and full aÅ¿Å¿urance of faith, and without wavering, as <hi>He.</hi> 10.22, 23, and c. 6.18.</p>
            <p>Whereas the very end of your aÅ¿Å¿ertion tendeth to no other but to put if poÅ¿Å¿ible even Gods very Elect, and Å¿uch who know they are Å¿o, into doubts and fears: who ought not to caÅ¿t away their Å¿trong confidence which hath great recompence of Reward, Å¿ee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. for in Å¿o doing they caÅ¿t away even their Å¿piritual life: <hi>For the just live by faith,</hi> as verÅ¿e 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Secondly, I obÅ¿erve your judgement is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious to the ApoÅ¿tles judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea.</hi> For the ApoÅ¿tle was perÅ¿waded that neither height, nor depth, nor any other Creature Å¿hall be able to Å¿eparate us from the love of God which is in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Us, I Å¿ay, if we be his Elect. And the ApoÅ¿tle was perÅ¿waded that if God be for us, none can be againÅ¿t us, nor pluck us out of his hands, nor lay anything to our charge, but we Å¿hall be more than conquerors, through him that loved us, as verÅ¿e 31, 32, 33, 37. And that without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whom God hath foreknown he alÅ¿o hath predeÅ¿tinate to be conformed to the image of his Å¿onne, And whom he hath predeÅ¿tinate them he alÅ¿o calleth; and whom he calleth, them he alÅ¿o juÅ¿tifieth, and whom he juÅ¿tifieth, them he alÅ¿o glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as v. 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>And the ApoÅ¿tle is of opinion and doth affirm <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17.18. That God willing more abundantly to Å¿hew unto the heirs of promiÅ¿e the immutabilitie of his counÅ¿el, confirmed it by an oath, that Å¿o they might have Å¿trong conÅ¿olation.</p>
            <p>But you hold and teach that notwithÅ¿tanding any Å¿uch decree, or immutable counÅ¿el, or foreknowledge, or predeÅ¿tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or election of God, yet if they come to years of diÅ¿cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h: which to me Å¿eemeth very Å¿trange.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29921:6"/>
            <p>Now you put in an ingredient Å¿o quite contradictory to what you aÅ¿Å¿ented to before, that I hope your own aÅ¿Å¿entings when you Å¿ee them unveiled, will clearly convince you that your own diÅ¿Å¿entings are not only contradictious to your own aÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but to the truth it Å¿elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea.</hi> For you hold and teach that God hath not decreed from eternity to elect any perÅ¿on of mankind (upon any terms) but that in caÅ¿e he liveth to years of diÅ¿cretion he may very poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibly periÅ¿h.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherein firÅ¿t you affirm as much as if you Å¿hould Å¿ay, That God had not decreed from eternity to elect ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf upon any terms, but in caÅ¿e he lived, as that he did, to years of diÅ¿cretion, he might poÅ¿Å¿ibly have periÅ¿hed. The which I hope you will not affirm. And therefore thus far I hope you will grant conviction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, In that your generall terms do exclude all and every perÅ¿on of mankind as that in your apprehenÅ¿ions not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the decree of God to have Å¿ome elect (and that a certain number, as that you acknowledge, and that he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably decreed what that number Å¿hall be)</p>
            <p>Yet you affirm, as much as if you Å¿hould Å¿ay, that all Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may very poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h, notwithÅ¿tanding Gods decree to Å¿ave Å¿ome. Thus far I hope alÅ¿o you will deny even you own aÅ¿Å¿ertions.</p>
            <p>Now in regard I hope you will grant that the Election of ChriÅ¿t Å¿tandeth Å¿ure, and that he could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall aÅ¿Å¿ume a little further that you will alÅ¿o grant that Å¿uch who are elected in time, by the Å¿ame hand (that elected ChriÅ¿t in the fulneÅ¿s of time from the loines of the Virgin) Å¿uch I Å¿ay whom God electeth, from the very loines of their natural parents, by means of propagation, as he did ChriÅ¿t: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for Å¿hame deny but their Election alÅ¿o Å¿tandeth Å¿ure, Å¿o that they cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> But ChriÅ¿t which Å¿anctifieth, and they which are Å¿anctified, are all (of one) that is the are all (of God) as ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf was of God, for which cauÅ¿e he was not aÅ¿hamed to call them brethren, for it behoved ChriÅ¿t in all things to be made like unto his brethren, &amp;c. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.17.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29921:6"/>
            <p>They are not of the world as he was not of the world. <hi>John</hi> 17.14.16.</p>
            <p>If they were of the world, the world would love his own, but ChriÅ¿t hath choÅ¿en them out of the world, and therfore the world hateth them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p>Ye have not choÅ¿en me, but I have choÅ¿en you, and ordained you, &amp;c. verÅ¿e 16. Å¿aith our bleÅ¿Å¿ed Savior, to whom God hath given power over all fleÅ¿h that he Å¿hould give eternal life to as many as God had given him. <hi>John</hi> 17.2.</p>
            <p>Some are of the world, and therefore it is that they Å¿peak of the world, and the world heareth them.</p>
            <p>But Å¿ome are of God, and he that knoweth God heareth them, but he that is not of God heareth them not; and thereby may be known the Å¿pirit of truth and the Å¿pirit of error: Å¿ee 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.5, 6. And again, He that is of God heareth Gods words, Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, ye therfore hear them not becauÅ¿e ye are not of God, <hi>John</hi> 8.47.</p>
            <p>So that it is clear Å¿ome are of God before they hear God words, and do therfore hear them becauÅ¿e they are of God, and not of the world: For the truth is they are Å¿o of God by generation, as that God is the chief cauÅ¿e of their very Å¿epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or propagation from the very loines of their natural parents. And this is properly their actual election, which is accompliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in time according to his eternal purpoÅ¿e, or counÅ¿el of his will to elect in ChriÅ¿t; having in his immutable counÅ¿el, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with himÅ¿elf, what he would effect and bring to paÅ¿s in time; for he worketh all things (in time) according to his eternal purpoÅ¿e or counÅ¿el of his will before there was time.</p>
            <p>But without all queÅ¿tion Å¿uch who are thus Å¿eparated by the hand of God through means of generation, and Å¿o are properly Å¿elected out of the world, as peculiarly his own; theÅ¿e you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuÅ¿e but muÅ¿t needs acknowledge their election is Å¿ure in the Å¿ight of God, Å¿o as they cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>And again, Å¿o many as God had called, juÅ¿tified, and Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, them you muÅ¿t needs acknowledge Å¿hall be glorified, and Å¿o cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly periÅ¿h: elÅ¿e you deny theÅ¿e plain expreÅ¿Å¿ions of the Holy GhoÅ¿t before cited, and go about alÅ¿o, as hath been Å¿aid, to put even the beÅ¿t and holieÅ¿t men into doubts, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29921:7"/>fears, whereas you Å¿hould labour to edifie in the faith and not to deÅ¿troy their faith.</p>
            <p>So that I cannot imagine what you Å¿hould poÅ¿Å¿ibly mean, or intend in this doctrine; unleÅ¿s you Å¿o judge as that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God or counÅ¿el of his will before the world began, was not Å¿o capacious and comprehenÅ¿ious as to determine before hand what Å¿hould certainly become of every particular perÅ¿on that Å¿hould be begotten from the beginning to the end: But only determined with himÅ¿elf concerning the Å¿pecies or certain kinds of men, in the groÅ¿s, or general and no further at all, as Å¿o you Å¿eem to expreÅ¿s your Å¿elf, Å¿aying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no Election, or Decree of Election of particular perÅ¿ons as Å¿uch, but only of an intire species of men from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> In which aÅ¿Å¿ertion you plainly deny the omniÅ¿ciency of God, and render him to us altogether blind in reÅ¿pect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars till they be exiÅ¿tent, and Å¿o you alÅ¿o exclude the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf as hath been Å¿aid, and every other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the Elect of God, out of his eternal purpoÅ¿e: as though he had not known as well the particulars, as the groÅ¿s and generall of all his works, from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>Whereas the text is clear, that he worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counÅ¿el of his own will, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.11. And it is alÅ¿o clear that his underÅ¿tanding is Infinite, Å¿ee <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 147.5.</p>
            <p>So that he cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be ignorant any more of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars than of the intire Å¿pecies, or Å¿orts of people: for if he were ignorant of any thing; his underÅ¿tanding were not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
            <p>And if he did any thing at all in time, that he had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed in himÅ¿elf in the counÅ¿el of his will before-time. Then he could not be Å¿aid to work all things according to his own purpoÅ¿e, or the counÅ¿el of his will.</p>
            <p>For if any particular work Å¿hould be effected by him which he did not purpoÅ¿e in the CounÅ¿el of his will; that particular work could not properly be Å¿aid to be effected according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el of his will, nor as he had purpoÅ¿ed in himÅ¿elf, if he did not purpoÅ¿e that very particular work.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29921:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you it may be will object, <hi>That what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be done to or concerning all Å¿uch of the Å¿ame kind or Å¿pecies, is alÅ¿o decreed to be done to every particular of Å¿uch species or kinds of poople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, true; But upon what ground can you poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibly exclude out of the preÅ¿cience or foreknowledge of God, the foreÅ¿ight and knowledge of every particular work that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿heth in time? How can you prove that he did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e that very particular work?</p>
            <p>Can you poÅ¿Å¿ibly imagine that he did not foreÅ¿ee from the very beginning all, paÅ¿t, preÅ¿ent, and future occurrences, that have been, are, or Å¿hall be effected to the very end? How dare you limit the Holy One of IÅ¿rael and Å¿o diminiÅ¿h his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes? Whereas you well know His underÅ¿tanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Therefore he is not ignorant of any occurrences from the beginning to the end. And though many things Å¿eem unpoÅ¿Å¿ible unto men, yet with God all things are poÅ¿Å¿ible Å¿aith our bleÅ¿Å¿ed Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Therefore it is poÅ¿Å¿ible that he Å¿hould foreÅ¿ee all and every particular effect and occurrences from the beginning to the end; this you cannot deny it were abÅ¿urd if you Å¿hould. And you know likewiÅ¿e that <hi>The very hairs of our heads are numbred; and that a Å¿parrow falleth not to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of our heavenly Father.</hi> Which one would think were matters of too little moment for our wiÅ¿e Father to reckon up, or regard, and take notice of. But the reaÅ¿on is, he being om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreÅ¿ent and omniÅ¿cient and that eternally cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be ignorant of the leaÅ¿t occurrences that may poÅ¿Å¿ibly inÅ¿ue. He being an infinite Å¿pirit, and all things being naked and open before him, and that from the very beginning, he declareth the end from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>He Å¿aith unto <hi>Job, Where waÅ¿t thou when I laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Earth? declare if thou hast underÅ¿tanding.</hi> See <hi>Job.</hi> 38.4.</p>
            <p>By which it appeareth that the Lord well knew and could alÅ¿o declare where the very materials of <hi>Job</hi> were of which he was compoÅ¿ed: and that from the very beginning.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29921:8"/>
            <p>And <hi>Job</hi> acknowledgeth alÅ¿o: I know that thou canÅ¿t do every thing, and that no thought can be hid from thee. Chap. 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay he underÅ¿tandeth our thoughts long before we think them.</p>
            <p>The Lord foreÅ¿aw and diÅ¿covered unto <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of IÅ¿rael would do after his deceaÅ¿e, and therefore gave him a propheticall Å¿ong to be a witneÅ¿s againÅ¿t them. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.16. &amp;c. to the 22. He knew their Imagination which they went about even then before he brought them into the land.</p>
            <p>But I Å¿hould hope that you would not Å¿tand in Å¿uch conceits and miÅ¿apprehenÅ¿ions as to Å¿et bounds and limits to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding and knowledge of God, which is infinite and unÅ¿ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable, and his waies in Å¿ome things paÅ¿t finding out.</p>
            <p>And if you will allow and do affirm with us that God was not ignorant what particular occurrences, both good and evill, Å¿hould happen unto all both Elect and Reprobates, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end: Then we muÅ¿t needs infer, and that from your own aÅ¿Å¿entings, that they are quite contradictory to your own aÅ¿Å¿entings.</p>
            <p>For you affirm page 1. particular the fourth, <hi>That the decrees of God concerning Election and Reprobation are abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Immutable and unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> From which I argue.</p>
            <p>That if the Decree of God be unchangeable in reÅ¿pect of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, And that from Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Then it neceÅ¿Å¿arily followeth; that he reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none whom he decreed to elect; Nor electeth any whom he decreed to reprobate. Provided alwaies, that, as hath been Å¿aid, he was not ignorant of the particular perÅ¿ons both of the Elect and Reprobates, and of all occurrences that Å¿hould enÅ¿ue from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> For if he was not ignorant of the particulars as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that we deny his omniÅ¿ciency to be from eternity, and his underÅ¿tanding to be infinite, as hath been Å¿aid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Then it is unpoÅ¿Å¿ible but his Decree and counÅ¿ell and purpoÅ¿e of his will was perfect and compleat and clear in himÅ¿elf concerning every parricular both whom he would Elect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29921:8"/>and whom he would reprobate: And this precedent, perfect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate decree, being granted alÅ¿o to be abÅ¿olutely immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Then it is unpoÅ¿Å¿ible that any particular whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to Elect actually in time, Å¿hould become a Reprobate, nor any of thoÅ¿e whom he decreed to Reprobate, Å¿hould become his Elect.</p>
            <p>Which quite contradicteth your firÅ¿t particular, wherein you diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent from us about this head of doctrine, wherein you affirm that <hi>God hath not decreed from eternity to elect any perÅ¿on of mankind upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terms, but that in caÅ¿e he liveth to years of diÅ¿cretion he may poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly periÅ¿h, notwithÅ¿tanding any Å¿uch decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the like arguments may be brought likewiÅ¿e againÅ¿t your 2d. particular, to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God hath not decreed from eternity the Reprobation of any perÅ¿on of mankind, conÅ¿idered as Å¿uch, who may not very poÅ¿Å¿ibly be Å¿aved, any decree in God notwithstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much leÅ¿s do you hold a decree of Reprobation from Eternity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the farr greateÅ¿t part of mankind, excluding a poÅ¿Å¿ibility of Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>For if you do aÅ¿Å¿ent <hi>That the decrees of God in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects are abÅ¿olutely immutable and unchangeable:</hi> your aÅ¿Å¿ent herein is quite contradictory to your diÅ¿Å¿enting, in this alÅ¿o, for the decree of God is as abÅ¿olute in the one as in the other, and as unchangeable like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>For his decrees Å¿hall Å¿tand, and he will do all his pleaÅ¿ure, Yea, <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth, yea Å¿o many as he loves he will rebuke and chasten, and will give them repentance unto life that they may be Å¿aved; Yea, he will give them faith, for faith is the gift of God,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 2.8. Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>For by grace ye are Å¿aved through faith, and that not of your Å¿elves, it is the gift of God.</hi> See verÅ¿e 9, 10. <hi>It is therefore of God that Å¿ome repent and believe, and Å¿o are Å¿aved, and not of themÅ¿elves, nor for their good works, lest any man Å¿hould boaÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other part there are Å¿ome others whom he blindeth and hardeneth, and Å¿hutteth or dulleth both their ears and hearts, <hi>leÅ¿t they Å¿hould repent and turn, and he Å¿hould heal them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though you think it Å¿o unjuÅ¿t and partial, and unequal, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿o croÅ¿s or oppoÅ¿ite to your rationalitie, and to the eÅ¿Å¿entiall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29921:9"/>of God (as Å¿o you affirm page 81.) to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is as a black thred of inconÅ¿istency with the attributes of God, to wit, his immutability, Å¿implicity, wiÅ¿dome, grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, justice, and love to mankind;</hi> InÅ¿omuch that though you are moÅ¿t vehemently and even paÅ¿Å¿ionately inclined to unity and peace with your brethren in matters of faith, yet are you not able with the beÅ¿t of your underÅ¿tandings to reconcile their doctrines in the points diÅ¿Å¿ented, with theÅ¿e glorious properties and perfections of our ever bleÅ¿Å¿ed God.</p>
            <p>Yet it doth not therefore follow but the wiÅ¿dome of God is able to convince you that theÅ¿e doctrines of your brethrens are fully and clealy reconcileable with theÅ¿e glorious properties and perfections of our bleÅ¿Å¿ed God.</p>
            <p>And what know you but God may poÅ¿Å¿ibly uÅ¿e Å¿ome very mean, and unworthy inÅ¿trument, to convince you of it, that Å¿o the whole glory of the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of Å¿uch deep Å¿ecrets might be given unto God, and not unto men.</p>
            <p>And therefore accounting of my Å¿elf both Å¿ufficiently mean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and unlikely (as of my Å¿elf) for Å¿uch a buÅ¿ineÅ¿s,</p>
            <p>And having formerly been of the Å¿ame mind in which I think you are in Å¿ome particulars conceming theÅ¿e points, and by the grace of God have receivd Å¿atisfaction &amp; full reÅ¿olution from the word of truth, I Å¿hall make bold, though but Å¿uch a man, to give you Å¿ome hints how theÅ¿e glorious attributes of our bleÅ¿Å¿ed God may be fully cleared, and that to any rational apprehenÅ¿ion in al theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects; If you pleaÅ¿e to read them with Å¿erious, mature, and deliberate conÅ¿ideration, and with impartial minds, and a reÅ¿olution to act accordingly; for then you have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e to know of the doctrine whether it be of God or but of humane invention.</p>
            <p>And this I Å¿hall indeavour as it pleaÅ¿eth God to give me utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>But according as you require I Å¿hall firÅ¿t follow you in your own reaÅ¿ons and Å¿enÅ¿e which cauÅ¿eth you to diÅ¿Å¿ent in theÅ¿e particulars from your acknowledged brethren.</p>
            <p>Wherein I Å¿hall make it appear that theÅ¿e your reaÅ¿ons Å¿tand in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoÅ¿ition againÅ¿t the wiÅ¿dome of God, Who can make it appear he is wiÅ¿er than men.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29921:9"/>the Å¿criptures to and againÅ¿t believers in caÅ¿e of apoÅ¿tacie, &amp;c. to be abÅ¿olutely inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with a peremptory intent in God to Å¿ave them, as Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>compared with verÅ¿e</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>compared with Rom.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8. <hi>And again you judge it a very Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿s part in a father to give his child a compleat aÅ¿Å¿urance under hand and Å¿eal that he will make him his heir against all poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interveniencies whatÅ¿oever, And yet preÅ¿ently threaten him if he be not dutifull to diÅ¿inherit him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, that you either in this therefore erre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e you know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God, Or elÅ¿e you willfully oppoÅ¿e even the wiÅ¿dome of God, as accounting it fooliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>For you cannot but know that thus it is in the promulgation of the GoÅ¿pell. And that it is commanded, and ought to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all in generall, like a draw-net caÅ¿t into the Sea: And the promiÅ¿e and threatning to be preached together, and not Å¿ingle by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves; to wit, <hi>He that repenteth and believeth Å¿hall be Å¿aved, he that believeth not Å¿hall be condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this notwithÅ¿tanding that you know it thus commanded, yet in your wiÅ¿dome it is inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with a peremptory decree to Å¿ave Å¿ome and to damn others; and you judge it a Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿s part in God, as in a Father, to give his children compleat aÅ¿Å¿urance, and after threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to diÅ¿inherit them in caÅ¿e of diÅ¿obedience: As if you had quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that it had Å¿o pleaÅ¿ed him as by the fooliÅ¿hneÅ¿s of preaching to Å¿ave them that believe, and whom he predeÅ¿tinates to the end, he alÅ¿o predeÅ¿tinates to the means. And thoÅ¿e who are kept by the power of God through faith unto Å¿alvation, yet he rebuketh and chaÅ¿teneth them, and threatneth them alÅ¿o if they be not obedient; yea, and deÅ¿erteth them alÅ¿o, &amp; hideth his face, as though he had forÅ¿aken them: And all this likewiÅ¿e after he hath given them aÅ¿Å¿urance of eternal life through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, as I hope you know, that after a full aÅ¿Å¿urance in times of deÅ¿ertion men may Å¿tand in doubt: it was Å¿o with <hi>David</hi> and many others; many eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings in reÅ¿pect of Å¿trength and weakneÅ¿s of faith there is found in all by ordinary experience. But to proceed, you in your judgement have already judged it a very Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿s part in a Father to give a child a compleat aÅ¿Å¿urance under hand and Å¿eal, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the 3d. you account of an enemy unto godlineÅ¿s, and that the reÅ¿ult of it muÅ¿t needs make men remiÅ¿s, looÅ¿e, and indifferent in the Å¿ervice of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29921:10"/>God, &amp;c. Whereas the wiÅ¿dome of God hath already judged it a means to make us more zealous and cordiall: and therefore it is that he giveth knowledge of Å¿alvation to his people by the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿ins, that they might Å¿erve him without fear in holineÅ¿s and righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s all the daies of their lives. And fear hath torment in it, you know, and he that feareth is not yet perfect in love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> But we ought to endeavour to be perfect in love, and are bid alÅ¿o <hi>Fear not little flock, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Therfore it followeth, that in the wiÅ¿dom of God, &amp; through his love to his people, he would have them to attain perfection both in faith and love, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12, 13. yea even Å¿uch degrees whereby they might have Å¿trong conÅ¿olation, and whereby their joy might be full, and therefore he biddeth them ask and they Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And the <hi>Apostle John</hi> writeth unto them purpoÅ¿ely that they might know that they have eternal life, and Å¿heweth them by what Å¿igns they may certainly know it; to wit, by their faith and love which God had given them: he that believeth on the Å¿onne of God Å¿aith he, hath the witneÅ¿s in himÅ¿elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> Therefore it followeth, he that thus believeth can never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h, <hi>For who can pluck them out of the hands of God who is greater than all? and who can terminate an eternall life. And he that knoweth he believeth on the bleÅ¿Å¿ed name of the Å¿onne of God, and that loveth God, and loveth his brethren for their likeneÅ¿s unto God, may certainly know that he hath already this eternal life abiding in him, and that he Å¿hall never periÅ¿h. And by how much Å¿tronger confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence any man attains, and fuller aÅ¿Å¿urance of faith, through the grace of God: By Å¿o much the more Å¿hall his love abound, and Å¿o by conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence his zeal in religion, and cordiallneÅ¿s in Å¿ervice will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas you Å¿ay, <hi>who will Å¿train and toil himÅ¿elf in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for Å¿uch a prize which he knowes he Å¿hall as certainly obtain by going an eaÅ¿ie, Å¿oft, and ordinary pace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anÅ¿wer, you Å¿peak in this as though all Gods elect were at the firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, and had no need to Å¿trive to enter in at the Å¿trait gate, or to <hi>make their calling and election Å¿ure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as though it were all one what degrees and meaÅ¿ures of faith and holineÅ¿s we attain unto, and whether we be rich or poor, both in faith and good works.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:29921:10"/>
            <p>As though degrees of grace, and meaÅ¿ures and multiplicity of good works and Å¿ufferings, &amp;c. Å¿hould not add unto us a far more excellent and eternal weight of immortal glory.</p>
            <p>Whereas I know you know it, and will acknowledge there Å¿hall be great inequality of reward both to the Elect and Reprobates though nothing contradictious to juÅ¿tice or equality in reÅ¿pect of deÅ¿ert: But Å¿uitable to their works according to their works, whether better or worÅ¿e, yea, more or fewer, as the Scripture is clear. And therefore I cannot but wonder to Å¿ee you propoÅ¿e this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>They that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize.</hi> All Gods Elect may be Å¿aid to run, but not all alike for celeritie and attainments, <hi>Å¿ome of the first Å¿hall be last, and Å¿ome of the last Å¿hall be firÅ¿t, in reÅ¿pect of attainments to degrees and meaÅ¿ures of faith and love, which are (eÅ¿Å¿entially) in ChriÅ¿t Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for anÅ¿wer to your Å¿econd particular ReaÅ¿on, page 3. the which I over-skipped to anÅ¿wer the firÅ¿t and third both at once being one in Å¿ubÅ¿tance, I onely anÅ¿wer thus much briefly, That they are very children in underÅ¿tanding that cannot refell this argument, to wit, that becauÅ¿e the decree of God hath Å¿o adjudged Å¿ome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perÅ¿ons to eternall life through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, as Å¿o you know we affirm, that he hath <hi>choÅ¿en us in him before the foundation of the world was laid,</hi> and not peculiarly without him and his Å¿ufferings, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore yet you infer <hi>That Å¿uch an election is extremely inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the death of Christ, and utterly diÅ¿Å¿olveth the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of it. Which cannot be reÅ¿ented from Å¿uch knowing men, but as purpoÅ¿ely intended to deceive the Å¿imple:</hi> You knowing the principles of all underÅ¿tanding men to be quite contrary, and too well fortifyed to be deceived with Å¿uch inconÅ¿equent aÅ¿Å¿ertions: For it is but thus much in effect, to wit,</p>
            <p>BecauÅ¿e in the preÅ¿cienceor foreknowledge and counÅ¿el of his will he hath choÅ¿en us in ChriÅ¿t, to be Å¿aved eternally through his death and Å¿ufferings, and for his Å¿ake: <hi>Ergo, Such ad Election is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious to the death of Christ, and utterly diÅ¿Å¿olveth the neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29921:11"/>
            <p>How extremely injurious unto Rationality this argument is, I leave to all, yea, even Children of ten years of age, to judge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I come now to anÅ¿wer your fourth Argument, where you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, <hi>That Å¿uch a notion of Election layes the greateÅ¿t part of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of preaching of the word in the very duÅ¿t, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anÅ¿wer, your Argument is a meer <hi>non Å¿equitur,</hi> for it is all but thus much, to wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> BecauÅ¿e it hath pleaÅ¿ed God to determine before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world to Å¿ave thoÅ¿e that believe through the preaching of the word, and through ChriÅ¿t, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the preaching of the word, or to perÅ¿wade men to attend thereupon, is in vain and needleÅ¿s, for the Elect Å¿hall as certainly be Å¿aved, &amp;c. If they Å¿hould not do it.</p>
            <p>You have forgotten I Å¿uppoÅ¿e how <hi>Paul</hi> was inhibited to go unto Å¿uch a place becauÅ¿e they would not receive his doctrine, but was Å¿ent unto another, and bid to <hi>Å¿peak boldly, &amp;c. becauÅ¿e he had much people in that City:</hi> For you might know if Å¿uch Scriptures could down with you, <hi>That whom he foreknew, them he alÅ¿o predeÅ¿tinated to be conform'd to the image of his Son, and whom he predeÅ¿tinated them he alÅ¿o called, and whom he called them he alÅ¿o juÅ¿tified, and whom he justified them he alÅ¿o glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In your fifth Argument you take upon you to argue directly, and bring a falÅ¿e Å¿lander upon the WiÅ¿dome, HolineÅ¿s, Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice of God: For your Argument were good if rightly grounded. But your ground-work, which without all queÅ¿tion you take for granted, is manifeÅ¿tly untrue.</p>
            <p>For though all have Å¿inned, and are therefore deprived of the glory of God, and are only Å¿aved through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, yea Jews <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being Children of wrath as well as others,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet it doth not follow that all by nature are in their child-hood and minority alike Å¿inful, alike wrathful, or alike unclean, but in the Å¿ight of God, and Å¿ometimes of men likewiÅ¿e, there is great difference, though I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s if any ask me who maketh thee to differ, and what haÅ¿t thou that thou haÅ¿t not received, I muÅ¿t acknowledge God himÅ¿elf hath done it.</p>
            <p>But this I affirm, and can make it manifeÅ¿t, that there was a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence even betwixt <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>EÅ¿au,</hi> in their Mothers Womb, ElÅ¿e
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29921:11"/>it had never been Å¿aid, <hi>I have loved Jacob, and have hated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿au.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Å¿o the holy GhoÅ¿t telleth us <hi>the wicked are eÅ¿tranged from the Womb, they go aÅ¿tray as Å¿oon as they be born, Å¿peaking lies, &amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> hath teÅ¿tified, the efficient cauÅ¿e is not in God, but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us plainly <hi>They have corrupted themÅ¿elves, their Å¿pot is not the Å¿pot of his Children, they are a crooked and perverÅ¿e generation;</hi> they are perverÅ¿ly generated; Å¿ome generations of Vipers, Å¿ome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wickedneÅ¿s, becauÅ¿e Å¿piritual wickedneÅ¿s was the productive cauÅ¿e of their generation; Å¿ome Å¿onnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> for Satan was the cauÅ¿e of their generation, and therefore though they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children after the fleÅ¿h, yet our Saviour telleth them <hi>They were of their father the Devil, and would do his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Å¿ome alÅ¿o are called <hi>Children of the fleÅ¿h</hi> in oppoÅ¿ition to him that was born by promiÅ¿e, to wit, <hi>At Å¿uch a time will I come unto thee, and Sarah Å¿hall have a Son;</hi> The Lord himÅ¿elf was the chief cauÅ¿e of his generation, it was he that Å¿eparated him from the loines of his Parents, of free accord, whereas the devill, the world, or Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleÅ¿h was the cauÅ¿e of the begetting of Å¿ome others, as hath been clearly Å¿hewed; but of this more fully in another place.</p>
            <p>But you may hereby Å¿ee and be more cautious for ever after of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the wiÅ¿dome and holineÅ¿s of God becauÅ¿e you Å¿ee not how your Å¿elves forÅ¿ooth can clear it up.</p>
            <p>You might as well have Å¿aid, <hi>If he have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> he is doubtleÅ¿s unjuÅ¿t, unmerciful, unholy, unwife: which I for my part if I Å¿hould have Å¿aid it, it had been blaÅ¿phemous in me, but I hope you did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and therefore upon repentance may find mercy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To your Å¿ixth I anÅ¿wer, That no man that ever I heard, Å¿pake of any more decrees of Election but one, yet there are Å¿o many particular actual elections as there are particular perÅ¿ons Elected from the loins of their parents, as the chief cauÅ¿e of their generation, and this is their election when they are thus Å¿eparated to be veÅ¿Å¿els of mercy prepared unto glory.</p>
            <p>But God is not the cauÅ¿e of the generation as chiefly predominant, but only permiÅ¿Å¿ive of the propagation of any children but his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</p>
            <p n="7">7. Your Å¿eventh I anÅ¿wer by way of Retortion or countercharge,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29921:12"/>That we do conceive that all the paÅ¿Å¿ages and texts of Scriptures which you produce and argue for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of your errours are meerly irrelative to Å¿uch a purpoÅ¿e, all them forced againÅ¿t their native and proper imports reÅ¿pectively to Å¿erve in this warfare, being all very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a more orthodox, fair, and ChriÅ¿tian interpretation than that which you make Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to your opinions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To the eighth in like manner I retort, we can find no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, indeed no tolerable Å¿atisfaction in any of thoÅ¿e arguments which you our brethren are wont to levie and inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon for the maintenance and Defence of your erronious doctrine; to wit, that there is no electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or decree of election of particular perÅ¿ons as Å¿uch, but only of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Å¿pecies of men from eternity; Å¿ee your Arg. 9.</p>
            <p>But do judge in our Å¿ouls and conÅ¿ciences that through the grace of God we Å¿hall be enabled to give a Rational, fair, and ChriÅ¿tian account of their inÅ¿ufficiency and weakneÅ¿s.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To the ninth I anÅ¿wer, that it hath more confirmed us in the truth, becauÅ¿e we find both from your pens and mouths, and that very frequently, Å¿uch very expreÅ¿Å¿ions as are palpable inconÅ¿iÅ¿tencies, and that your doctrine cumbreth and thwarteth plain texts of Scripture, and wholeÅ¿ome neceÅ¿Å¿ary truths in ChriÅ¿tian Religion, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny orthodox and worthy doctrines cannot be pertinently nor effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mannaged if we receive the influence, and Å¿eek the aid, of this your principle, to wit, that there is no election or decree of election of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perÅ¿ons as Å¿uch, but only of an intire Å¿pecies of men from eternity.</p>
            <p>For we affirm there is both, whereas your poÅ¿ition denyeth the truth of theÅ¿e Scriptures, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.4.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.7.8. to 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. To the firÅ¿t argument for your diÅ¿Å¿ent in the Å¿econd particular, I anÅ¿wer, that we believe theÅ¿e Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be really true, and that God doth intend as he here expreÅ¿Å¿eth: &amp; we do believe, that however wicked men are by nature and by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if God give them repentance unto life, Å¿o as that he doth Å¿ave them, this is nothing elÅ¿e but what he had decreed before the foundation of the world, and that Å¿uch very perÅ¿ons were choÅ¿en in ChriÅ¿t, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tinated to the adoption of Sons: And that he never intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons, and therefore gave them repentance, and did not Å¿uffer them to obdurate and remain impenitent, nor doth any decree of his neceÅ¿Å¿itate them or any other impulÅ¿ively to continue in Å¿uch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency; but permiÅ¿Å¿ively it doth, <hi>For he Å¿uffereth with long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29921:12"/>the veÅ¿Å¿els of warth fitted to deÅ¿truction, Rom.</hi> 9. and that purpoÅ¿ely to Å¿hew his wrath (againÅ¿t) and hatred (of) Å¿in, and to make his power known. And who are you that reply againÅ¿t God? as if his juÅ¿tice and mercy Å¿hould impell and neceÅ¿Å¿itate the Å¿alvation of all, or elÅ¿e you will conteÅ¿t and quarrel againÅ¿t him as you do herein, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in your Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on, accounting it as a bowelleÅ¿s and mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s Reprobation of the far greater part of mankind, which yet you cannot deny but the words of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf import Å¿o much if we may believe him, <hi>Wide is the Gate, &amp;c. and many go in thereat:</hi> But in your apprehenÅ¿ins theÅ¿e words of ChriÅ¿t are utterly inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with thoÅ¿e pathetical, affectionate, and bowel-breathing wiÅ¿hes or deÅ¿ires of God for the peace and proÅ¿perity even of the vileÅ¿t men, as you imagine; Whereas theÅ¿e were all Å¿poken too and concerning his peculiar people; that they might have been happy, and their poÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities after them, if they had kept his commandments; and this he Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the manner of men; and if they had been obedient it had bin Å¿o with them; but we dare not conclude that God knew not before how they would carry and demean themÅ¿elves, for then we Å¿hould deny his underÅ¿tanding to be infinite: but theÅ¿e are Å¿poken for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and for our imitation, and there Å¿hould be in us Å¿uch like bowels &amp; earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ires as there was in ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿ider'd as man, to wit, that men would repent, and return and live; and they ought to perÅ¿wade what they can thereto, and Å¿uch who Å¿o do are inÅ¿trumentall in the hand of God for the good of many, and Å¿hall doubleÅ¿s receive a reward Å¿uitable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your third ReaÅ¿on is in effect but the Å¿ame with this, <hi>Intending to prove it as a brand of crueltie and folly if God Å¿hould reprobate his own, as the</hi> OÅ¿trich <hi>is cruell againÅ¿t her young ones.</hi> And to this I aÅ¿Å¿ent if he Å¿hould be cruel to his own elect, and that is all you can make of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ReaÅ¿on the fourth you proceed on in the Å¿ame tone, replying and arguing againÅ¿t God, becauÅ¿e <hi>He doth reprobate the greatest part of men, as if becauÅ¿e we are lineally deÅ¿cended from the loins of</hi> Adam <hi>we were all alike by generation, and in alike meaÅ¿ure children of wrath:</hi> which I have already anÅ¿wered that it is not Å¿o.</p>
            <p>And further I adde for your fuller conviction, that all reprobates are the natural off-Å¿pring, and fruit of Å¿in, and are the children of the wicked one, that is, the devil, in that reÅ¿pect: for it was the devil
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29921:13"/>that Å¿owed the tares, that is to Å¿ay Å¿in, in the heats of our firÅ¿t parents, which have brought forth more tares, than the good Å¿eed, which was of God, and was left as a Remnant of the image of God in our firÅ¿t parents, hath yet produced; So that it is not proper to Å¿ay of the wicked, <hi>that they are lineally deÅ¿cended from God, through the loines of</hi> Adam, <hi>who was his Å¿on;</hi> but were blaÅ¿phemous in me to Å¿peak it; becauÅ¿e I thus apprehend and know it to be true.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You proceed, <hi>That all particular perÅ¿ons of mankind without exception of any, were in</hi> Adam <hi>before his fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence you gather, <hi>If they were in him before his fall, they muÅ¿t be in the Å¿ame Å¿tate, and condition of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s with him; and conÅ¿equently of grace, favour and acceptance with God. Now we judge it clearly impoÅ¿Å¿ible that any perÅ¿on Å¿hould at the Å¿ame time be in an eÅ¿tate of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s or of grace and favour with God, and yet under a Å¿evere decree of Reprobation alÅ¿o, Å¿o that we cannot but conceive Å¿uch a decree of Reprobation from eternity as our brethren maintain, to be a meer and plain ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, all mankind was originally in his loins, and he was made righteous, but they were not perÅ¿onally in him: But Å¿uppoÅ¿e it true, do not you conceive, that the Angells that Å¿inned, and are caÅ¿t down, and become devils, were created perfect and pure from Å¿in, and Å¿o in favour with God, whiles they Å¿o continued? yet were at that very time under a Å¿evere decree of eternall Reprobation; had not God decreed, and determined with himÅ¿elf, to Å¿uffer them to Å¿in, and fall as they did: and Å¿o in like manner, to Å¿uffer man alÅ¿o to be Å¿educed by him, cannot you believe it, <hi>that his decrees are unchanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as you grant at the firÅ¿t, and that <hi>God acteth nothing, in time, but what he decreed from eternity;</hi> And that <hi>the Scripture expreÅ¿ly holdeth forth, both a decree of Election, and a decree of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God,</hi> as you Å¿aid you <hi>agreed with your brethren in that,</hi> as in the 1.4.5. <hi>particulars?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether then have your arguments lead you, that you here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a plain ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibility? Å¿o that the decree of God was nothing at all from eternity concerning Reprobation, either of Angels or men, though the Scripture telleth us, that Å¿ome were of <hi>old ordained unto condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Å¿ome <hi>as natural brute beasts are made to be taken, and to be

            <p>And let me but ask you, doth he not will now, what he willed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even from eternity? is his will changed, or doth he will any thing now that he did not then? But Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>What if he willing to Å¿hew his wrath, and make his power known, Å¿uffer with long patience the veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath fitted to deÅ¿truction;</hi> But if theÅ¿e were the ends of <hi>Å¿uffering theÅ¿e veÅ¿Å¿els,</hi> then it muÅ¿t needs follow that in the decree of God, he had this purpoÅ¿e in himÅ¿elf, as <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.9. where it is alÅ¿o Å¿aid verÅ¿e 11. <hi>That he worketh all things according to the CounÅ¿el of his own will;</hi> Å¿o that we cannot believe, that he either doth, or Å¿uffereth to be done, any thing at all, but <hi>according to the counÅ¿el of his own will:</hi> For he that could foreÅ¿ee <hi>to predeÅ¿tinate</hi> Å¿uch who are his Elect, <hi>to the adoption of Children by JeÅ¿us Christ in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf according to the Good pleaÅ¿ure of his will,</hi> as <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.5. could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly be ignorant whom he Å¿hould <hi>harden</hi> unto condemnation. It were therefore wiÅ¿dome, if you could not comprehend the juÅ¿tneÅ¿s of his decree in this reÅ¿pect, yet not to make Å¿uch imperious and bold concluÅ¿ions, whiles you cannot reconcile theÅ¿e you: Å¿ubtill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with theÅ¿e texts of Scripture; for all Scripture is true, and muÅ¿t not be broken, to comply with our fancies, and weak apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But Argument Å¿ixth you Å¿peak more boldly, for becauÅ¿e <hi>all things were in God, and in his will, and power, before he created them and made them viÅ¿ible;</hi> Therefore you will needs make man, and not man only, but all things whatÅ¿oever, to be <hi>nothing really but God himÅ¿elf:</hi> according as you Å¿ay <hi>it is a known maxim, whatÅ¿oever is in God is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which maxim in one Å¿enÅ¿e may be true, to wit, whatÅ¿oever is in God Attributably and EÅ¿Å¿entially is God: but it is well known that all things yet Å¿till are really in God, but no creature can in any poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibility be God himÅ¿elf, for every creature is Å¿omething elÅ¿e: and therfore I much wonder that a whole Church Å¿hould aÅ¿Å¿ert Å¿uch doctrine.</p>
            <p>And before the creation, when all things were in God, they were then no more God himÅ¿elf, than the dung that is contained in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, of the bellie of man, is the man himÅ¿elf; And Å¿o by conÅ¿equence, notwithÅ¿tanding your bold Logick, God is no more <hi>the object of his own Reprobation, nor can no more be Å¿aid to reject
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29921:14"/>himÅ¿elf, or harden himÅ¿elf,</hi> than a man is Å¿aid to reject himÅ¿elf when he caÅ¿teth forth his moÅ¿t noiÅ¿ome dung; and therefore I might well retort it upon you, that you knowing theÅ¿e things, and that Å¿ome are rejected, and eternally damned, Å¿hould produce Å¿uch an argument, as if it did hold true, might induce the ignorant to blaÅ¿peme the name of the lord our God, to their own deÅ¿truction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To the Å¿eventh I anÅ¿wer that God doth not <hi>Å¿ay unto all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perÅ¿on of mankind, If thou believeÅ¿t, thou Å¿halt be Å¿aved:</hi> But as purpoÅ¿ely revealing his decree, Å¿o far as he hath thought fit to let us know, his expreÅ¿Å¿ions are thus; <hi>He that repenteth and believeth Å¿hall be Å¿aved, and he that believeth not Å¿hall be condemned.</hi> So that your commiÅ¿Å¿ion is for both, and you ought to preach both, and not the one Å¿ingle; for then you hide Å¿ome part of <hi>the counÅ¿el of God:</hi> And Å¿o your <hi>Major</hi> being gone, your <hi>Minor</hi> fails, and is not worth anÅ¿wering.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This eighth argument, is the Å¿ame in effect with the other, and no better grounded. It Å¿eems you are much offended, that the GoÅ¿pel muÅ¿t <hi>be preached unto all the world, and yet none but the Elect take hold of it by a lively faith, for their Å¿alvation;</hi> Now you it may be would be Å¿o wiÅ¿e, as to cull them forth, and tell them all plainly, you I have choÅ¿en, and you the reÅ¿t are Reprobates. Thus you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and reproach even the WiÅ¿dome of God himÅ¿elf, and yet therin Å¿hew but your own folly: for if the GoÅ¿pel Å¿hould be preached peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to the Elect, and they pointed out and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, &amp;c. how Å¿hould <hi>the rest be hardened?</hi> they would preÅ¿ently deÅ¿pair; and how Å¿hould <hi>the Gospel be preached unto all nations for a witneÅ¿s againÅ¿t them,</hi> and to <hi>be unto them,</hi> as Å¿o God hath appointed it, <hi>the Å¿avor of death unto death,</hi> and a means to reÅ¿train them, &amp;c?</p>

            </p>
            <p>To which I anÅ¿wer, that if you be Å¿o Å¿ober, and conÅ¿iderate, as not to <hi>meddle with it, nor adventure upon it,</hi> till you make it good, That <hi>all that hear it are Gods Elect, and Å¿hall certainly be Å¿av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>

            <p>However I Å¿hall Å¿peak unto you in Scripture language, but I will not cite the places to you, I hope you know it is contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>That he worketh all things according to the counÅ¿ell of his will, and that his counÅ¿ell Å¿hall stand, and he will do all his pleaÅ¿ure;</hi> yea, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth;</hi> yea, Å¿ome are Å¿aid to be <hi>of old ordained unto condemnation,</hi> and <hi>as brute beasts are made to be taken and to be deÅ¿troyed;</hi> And <hi>he made all things for himÅ¿elf, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil;</hi> for he hath <hi>power,</hi> and juÅ¿tly too, as <hi>the Potter of his clay,</hi> to <hi>make one veÅ¿Å¿el unto honour, and another unto diÅ¿honour,</hi> and that of the Å¿ame clay; Å¿uch whom he maketh as <hi>veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath unto diÅ¿honour,</hi> he maketh on purpoÅ¿e that <hi>he may Å¿hew his wrath:</hi> and he is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer it upon what accompt he maketh Å¿uch veÅ¿Å¿els, and to convince the conÅ¿ciences of all men whomÅ¿oever that it is but juÅ¿t, and will one day do it, againÅ¿t all their cavils, Å¿o as <hi>every mouth Å¿hall be Å¿top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:</hi> for Å¿hall we think it poÅ¿Å¿ible, but he that is <hi>the Judge of all the world Å¿hould do right?</hi> it were abÅ¿urd to think it. You Å¿ay you <hi>Gather by many things comming from them occaÅ¿ionally, That your brethren would willingly enough let go their doctrine of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation if they knew how to retain their doctrine of Election without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> It may well be that your brethren would not much Å¿trive with you about this doctrine, if they could help it; though they know it is true. But if you cannot teach them, how it is poÅ¿Å¿ible that this <hi>Doctrine of Election,</hi> which is very clear from expreÅ¿s Scriptures, can poÅ¿Å¿ibly chuÅ¿e, but muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily draw after it this premiÅ¿ed <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Reprobation,</hi> they will acknowledge you to be far more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional than any of them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>We clearly and very frequently find</hi> (you Å¿ay) <hi>both in the writings and oral diÅ¿courÅ¿es of the Patrons of the Å¿aid decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Å¿uch Å¿ayings and paÅ¿Å¿ages which we know not how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile with this decree, and conÅ¿equently cannot but judge Å¿uch a decree to be very diÅ¿harmonious to the true Å¿trains and doctrins of the GoÅ¿pel.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> The beÅ¿t patronage we have for it, is the word of God; and it is all that we dare cleave too, to make it out.</p>
            <p>But if your conÅ¿equence and judgement be groundedly raiÅ¿ed, to wit, <hi>That our doctrines are not harmonious with the GoÅ¿pel,</hi> then upon the Å¿ame ground we may paÅ¿s our judgement infallibly upon yours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For as hath been Å¿hewed, you firÅ¿t agree with us that <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreÅ¿ly holdeth forth and aÅ¿Å¿erteth both a decree of Election and a decree of Reprobation in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And that <hi>theÅ¿e decrees were in God from Eternity or before the foundatiens of the world were laid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And that <hi>both theÅ¿e decrees as well as all others attributable to God, are really and Å¿imply God himÅ¿elf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And that <hi>theÅ¿e decrees as all others in God are like God himÅ¿elf abÅ¿olutely immutable and unchangeable, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then in your very firÅ¿t particular of your diÅ¿Å¿ent from us, you quite contradict what you aÅ¿Å¿ented to, as hath been argued before, and repreÅ¿ent unto us the counÅ¿el and decree of God, as changeable as the Moon, or as the mind of man, as if the counÅ¿el of God were wholly dependent on the will of man, as if the wiÅ¿dome of God were not perfect and full for making his decrees abÅ¿olute, till he receive inÅ¿tructions from the actings of men how he Å¿hould judge them; you Å¿ay <hi>it is poÅ¿Å¿ible, notwithÅ¿tanding his Decree of Election,</hi> that <hi>his Elect Å¿hould periÅ¿h, and notwithstanding his Decree of Reprobation of any particular perÅ¿on, yet he may poÅ¿Å¿ibly be Å¿aved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we Å¿hall freely accord, that Å¿ome particular perÅ¿ons, which you or we think to be his Elect may poÅ¿Å¿ily periÅ¿h, or whom we think to be Reprobates, may poÅ¿Å¿ibly be Å¿aved.</p>
            <p>But to avouch it poÅ¿Å¿ible, that the Decree of God, concerning par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perÅ¿ons, is changeable, We dare not do it, unleÅ¿s you can aÅ¿Å¿ure us that he did not foreÅ¿ee from the beginning, who Å¿hould be Å¿aved, and who Å¿hould periÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>But all <hi>his Å¿heep,</hi> all his <hi>Elect,</hi> are <hi>choÅ¿en in</hi> ChriÅ¿t <hi>before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, that they Å¿hould be holy and without blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in love, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.4. and they are <hi>alÅ¿o predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Å¿onne:</hi> TheÅ¿e all being the <hi>Sheep</hi> of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>hear his voice, and he knoweth them, and they follow him, and he giveth unto them eternal liÅ¿e, and they Å¿hall never periÅ¿h, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29921:16"/>Å¿hall any man pluck them out of his hand, his father who gave hem to him is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of his fathers hand; And he and his father are one.</hi> See <hi>Jo.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>And all the reaÅ¿on that ChriÅ¿t renders why others <hi>believed not,</hi> is becauÅ¿e they were <hi>not his Å¿heep,</hi> verÅ¿e 26. they were none of his Elect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now your third particular head of doctrine, wherin you Å¿ay you diÅ¿Å¿ent from us, is,</p>
            <p>That <hi>God hath not decreed the Reprobation of any infant, dying before the commiÅ¿Å¿ion of actual Å¿in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, I was once of your mind in this particular, and was Å¿o perÅ¿waded upon the Å¿ame grounds that you here hold forth.</p>
            <p>But through the grace of God was long Å¿ince reÅ¿olved that it was not true.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t I thought as in your fourth reaÅ¿on, <hi>That the caÅ¿e of all infants dying before the commiÅ¿Å¿ion of actual Å¿in to be one and the Å¿ame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e I apprehended they were all alike, and in a like meaÅ¿ure by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath one as well and as much as another,</hi> and Å¿o either all Å¿aved or all damned.</p>
            <p>But I could not believe they were all damned for Å¿uch like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons as you here allege, therefore I concluded, they were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿aved.</p>
            <p>But upon better conÅ¿ideration, as it pleaÅ¿ed God to give me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand that though Jews <hi>by nature were children of wrath as well as Gentiles, which is the proper Å¿cope of that expreÅ¿Å¿ion, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2.3. as will appear by the context, and not that every particular child, is by nature alike, and in the Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure polluted with Å¿in, but though all were polluted in the Å¿ight of God, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf excepted, yet there was great difference and diÅ¿paritie amongÅ¿t them in the Å¿ight of God, which put me quite into another mind, and Å¿earching the Scriptures, I was preÅ¿ently confirmed quite the contrary. I Å¿hall therefore hold forth Å¿uch Scriptures and reaÅ¿ons, as confirmed me, and gave me full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olves in any queÅ¿tion that could be propoÅ¿ed concerning this doctrine of Election and Reprobation.</p>
            <p>And firÅ¿t then for proof, that all children when new born, are not in the Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure fleÅ¿h, nor alike fleÅ¿hly, nor that they are all alike,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29921:16"/>and in the Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure Å¿inful; or veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath, or in the State of wrath, nor alike beloved or hated of God, nor alike unclean or clean in his Å¿ight. It will evidently appear from the word of God: Though I do not Å¿ay I can make this difference appear unto men, whiles they are unborn, yet it will appear that there is then Å¿uch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Å¿ight of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firÅ¿t I argue; If God loveth one thing and hateth another, there is certainly a difference, and diÅ¿parity, betwixt thoÅ¿e things, in the Å¿ight of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea.</hi> For he loveth the good, and hateth the evil, and cannot both hate and love the very Å¿elf Å¿ame thing; nor as he cannot chuÅ¿e but hate the evil, Å¿o he cannot but love, whatever is good, for <hi>every good proceedeth of God.</hi> And it were no leÅ¿s than blaÅ¿phemie, to Å¿ay he loveth the evil, or hateth the good, as it may well be Å¿aid of Å¿ome wicked men who alwaies do Å¿o.</p>
            <p>Nor we may not Å¿ay, that the love or hatred of our wiÅ¿e God, is without a cauÅ¿e, and that juÅ¿t and clear, to his own comprehenÅ¿ion, though not ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AÅ¿Å¿um.</hi> But he <hi>loved Jacob and hated EÅ¿au when they were in the womb, and had neither of them done either good or evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq. Ergo,</hi> there was <hi>difference</hi> in the Å¿ight of God, when they were in the womb, one was then <hi>a veÅ¿Å¿el of wrath</hi> in fitting <hi>for destruction,</hi> and the other was doubtleÅ¿s <hi>a veÅ¿Å¿el of mercy in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If children were all alike by nature after their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the loines of their parents, and that there were <hi>no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (but as all are polluted and all are defiled, either leÅ¿s or more, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf excepted) Å¿o all were alike polluted and a like defiled, by means of generation, being <hi>conceived in iniquitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> 1. Then it would follow, that the <hi>juÅ¿t Lord,</hi> who <hi>will doe no iniquity,</hi> and who is <hi>Judge of all the World, Å¿hould not doe right,</hi> In <hi>viÅ¿iting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him; And Å¿hewing mercy unto thouÅ¿ands, to them that love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ConÅ¿eq.</hi> 2. And then it would likewiÅ¿e follow, that it were all one, and no greater diÅ¿paragement to be <hi>the children of fooles, and children of baÅ¿e men, that are viler than the earth,</hi> than the proper Å¿eed of Å¿uch

            <p>

The Å¿eed of evill doers Å¿hall never be renowned for ever: and therefore it is Å¿aid, Prepare a Å¿laughter for his children for the iniquity of their parents, that they doe not riÅ¿e up, nor poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e the land, nor fill the face of the world with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or as in our tranÅ¿lation, with (enemies.)

See <hi>Mat.</hi> 31.32, 33.</p>
            <p>From all which I argue: If Å¿ome be holy, and Å¿ome be unholy, when they are in the Å¿eed; and that in the very wombe, when they have not done either good or evill, and are therefore accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved or hated;</p>
            <p>Then it neceÅ¿Å¿arily followeth, that there is great diÅ¿parity, and a vaÅ¿t difference when they are in the wombe, and have not done either good or evill; much more then, when they are come to more maturity, and are brought forth allÅ¿o; for as they grow in ripeneÅ¿Å¿e, they grow in difference; and to be briefe and plaine, the difference is Å¿o great, as hath beene clearly Å¿hewed, that Å¿ome are properly Å¿onnes of God, through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, whilÅ¿t they are in the wombe; and Å¿ome are as properly the Å¿onnes of <hi>Belial:</hi> for as the firÅ¿t are begotten through the powerfull operation of the Spirit of God, Å¿anctifying the minds and affections of parents, and giving them grace, and affections Å¿uitable for generation, and to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e their veÅ¿Å¿els in holineÅ¿Å¿e and in honour, and Å¿o their Å¿eed is holy in a great meaÅ¿ure, in the Å¿ight of God, through his owne grace. So on the other part, the other are begotten through the powerfull operations of the Devill, the World, and their owne corrupt and fleÅ¿hly deÅ¿ires, which by the infligation of him that ruleth in the aire, and in the children of diÅ¿obediee, are kindled and enflamed with deÅ¿ires and affections, wicked and perverÅ¿e, and Å¿uch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy in the Å¿ight of God, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing their veÅ¿Å¿els in the luÅ¿t of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cence, as hath beene Å¿aid: So their very Å¿eed is polluted and uncleane
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29921:19"/>in the Å¿ight of God, when they have not done either good or evill; as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>EÅ¿au.</hi>

            <p>However, If thoÅ¿e that are thus wicked and uncleane before him, Å¿hall be by any meanes perÅ¿waded to repent and turne from Å¿uch their wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, and dee that which is lawfull and right before him, they Å¿hall Å¿urely live; for the Lord hath teÅ¿tified, he deÅ¿ireth not the death even of him that dieth, nor hath no pleaÅ¿ure in it, but rather that he Å¿hould repent and live. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. and <hi>Philemon</hi> v. 10, 19. and <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.19, 20. and verÅ¿e 16, 17, 18. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. So that it is poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they may be converted, and repent, and live. Though it cannot be denied, but God hath determined whom he will Å¿ave, and whom he will condemne; for Å¿o Å¿aith the Scripture, His underÅ¿tanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 33.11, 12. to 20.

               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, That it Å¿eems to me you cannot reconcile the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice and Å¿everity of God with his infinite Mercy: Yet if I might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿e you, I Å¿hould account it your wiÅ¿edome not to make too perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ConcluÅ¿ions upon Å¿uch PremiÅ¿es, leÅ¿t your own weakneÅ¿Å¿e in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comprehenÅ¿ion in Å¿uch caÅ¿es, be found to be the cauÅ¿e why you cannot make this reconciliation betwixt Infinite JuÅ¿tice, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy; for without all queÅ¿tion they are reconcileable, though you cannot doe it.</p>
            <p>It is Å¿aid, you know, that <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, and the Cities about them, are Å¿et forth for an example, Å¿uffering the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi> Jude verÅ¿. 7.</p>
            <p>This was an example of his Å¿evere juÅ¿tice; I cannot find but all their children in thoÅ¿e Cities doe Å¿uffer <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi> And if they doe Å¿o, then I hope you will not deny but it is juÅ¿t, for <hi>the juÅ¿t Lord will doe no iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I will not undertake to determine, that all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Å¿o the children of <hi>Corah and his company, that went down quick into the pit, doe Å¿uffer the vengeance of eternall fire;</hi> for it is a Å¿ecret: yet you cannot prove that any were Å¿aved that were Å¿o deÅ¿troy'd in his fierce wrath; nor can you ever prove that any that periÅ¿hed in the floud were Å¿aved, when he brought in the floud upon the world of the ungodly.</p>
            <p>But this is evident, that <hi>God viÅ¿iteth the iniquities of the fathers even upon the children, and that to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him:</hi> That is to Å¿ay, He looketh upon the iniquities of the fathers, as it were Å¿tamped on their children; for their likeneÅ¿Å¿e being Å¿tamped or impreÅ¿t on their children, by means of generation, he looketh on them, and accounteth of them, Å¿o Å¿oon as ever they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, to be vile, and odious, and abominable in his Å¿ight, and hateth them even then, as he did <hi>EÅ¿ay,</hi> when they are in the wombe; Å¿o that whether they live to years of diÅ¿cretion or no, it is all one; for if he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29921:21"/>once hate them, as that he muÅ¿t needs doe, if they be the off-Å¿pring of Satan, or of Å¿pirituall wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, I doe not Å¿ee but they muÅ¿t needs periÅ¿h, though they dye in infancy:</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>the off-Å¿pring</hi> of God, Å¿uch whom he Å¿eparateth from the loynes of their parents by means of generation, when ever they dye they are certainly Å¿aved, for <hi>he loveth the works of his own hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without all peradventure it may be Å¿aid of Å¿ome, as <hi>Job</hi> 10.10, 11, 12. <hi>He hath powred them forth like milk, and crudled them like cheeÅ¿e, and cloathed them with skin and fleÅ¿h, and fenced them with bones and Å¿inews; he hath granted them life and favour, and his viÅ¿itation hath preÅ¿erved their Å¿pirits.</hi> And though theÅ¿e things be Å¿ecret unto men, yet <hi>Job</hi> knew, <hi>that it was thus with God,</hi> v. 13. and therefore accounted himÅ¿elf peculiarly <hi>the work of his own hands,</hi> in direct oppoÅ¿ition to thoÅ¿e that are wicked: See verÅ¿. 3, 7, 8, 9. and that from this very ground, <hi>Is it good,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Job, that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e, that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t deÅ¿piÅ¿e the work of thine hands, and Å¿hine upon the counÅ¿ell of the wicked? Thou knoweÅ¿t that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. Thy hands have made me and faÅ¿hioned me together round about.</hi> As if he Å¿hould have Å¿aid, Thou haÅ¿t taken pains about me, even in my very generation, whereas it cannot be Å¿aid that thou doÅ¿t Å¿o to the wicked, and therefore theyare not Å¿o peculiarly thine own workmanÅ¿hip: they cannot be called <hi>a holy generation, a righteous Å¿eed, a Å¿eed reÅ¿erved of God, the off-Å¿pring of God, a choÅ¿en generation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. as hath been Å¿pecified before: It is more proper to call them <hi>generations of vipers, evill and adulterous generations, children of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿ons of Belial,</hi> yea even <hi>veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath</hi> made on purpoÅ¿e <hi>for the day of evill, made to be taken and to be deÅ¿troyed:</hi> Even as men Å¿ometimes make veÅ¿Å¿els for retention of noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, unclean and filthy things, that Å¿o they may caÅ¿t them forth, both veÅ¿Å¿ell and all, out of their Å¿ight and preÅ¿ence.</p>
            <p>For juÅ¿t Å¿o it is, God maketh the veÅ¿Å¿els for retention of wrath, or <hi>spirituall wickedneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> which by means of generation is propagated together with the Å¿eed of generation from the very loyns of parents: Which though we are not able to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h, nor diÅ¿cern the nature of <hi>spirituall wickedneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> nor how it is propagable from the loyns of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet we know it is Å¿o, and where it is predominant in the Å¿ight of God, and the more predominant that it is in any, the more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome Å¿uch are in his Å¿ight, and that in the very wombe.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:29921:21"/>
            <p>And this doth clear and fully reconcile the Mercy and JuÅ¿tice of God, and that againÅ¿t all the cavils and oppoÅ¿ition whatÅ¿oever that can be objected; yea though never Å¿o many, either children or others, doe eternally periÅ¿h, and Å¿uffer the vengeance of eternall fire, for it is but wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Å¿pirituall wickedneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> that is veÅ¿Å¿eld up <hi>againÅ¿t the day of wrath, and Å¿uffered with long patience, till it be fitted for deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and that on purpoÅ¿e that <hi>he may Å¿hew his wrath, and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Å¿inne,</hi> and that <hi>he may make his power known</hi> how he can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h, and that to all eternity, according to his Infinite JuÅ¿tice, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wrath and hatred of Å¿inne; as if need require, I Å¿hall Å¿hew at large, and anÅ¿wer all objections that can be produced, or that are held forth in your book or books, if this will not Å¿erve: but I love not to be tedious, if I may chuÅ¿e: And a word, they Å¿ay, is Å¿ufficient for wiÅ¿e men; I expect therefore that theÅ¿e brief hints may Å¿atisfie Å¿ome, till I have opportunity and occaÅ¿ion for a larger TreatiÅ¿e upon this Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if it Å¿o pleaÅ¿eth God.</p>

            <head>A brief Survey of the grand AbÅ¿urdities that neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow their erroneous Doctrines and Tenets.</head>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HEIR Doctrine implicitly denieth, that Faith is the gift of God, and that of free grace: And Å¿o they make faith as a thing in the power of the will of man, and Å¿o a thing meritorious in man, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>For by grace we are Å¿aved through faith, and that not of our Å¿elves, it is the gift of God.</hi> And <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 9. <hi>Not of works, leÅ¿t any man Å¿hould boast.</hi> And again, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 10. <hi>For we are his workmanÅ¿hip, created in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us unto good works, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It utterly denieth the eternall omniÅ¿ciency of God, and that <hi>his understanding is infinite, limiting the Holy One of IÅ¿rael</hi> only to the fore-knowledge of a generall entire Å¿pecies of men, which he decreed to elect <hi>in the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of time:</hi> As if his fore-knowledge, or counÅ¿ell of his will before the world began, had not been capable nor comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive, or at leaÅ¿t not extenÅ¿ive, to foreÅ¿ee the very particulars, and every occurrence that Å¿hould befall, from the beginning to the end, as he did the generals, and the Å¿pecies, &amp;c. quite contradictory to theÅ¿e Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 147.5. <hi>Great is the Lord, and of great power, his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding is infinite.</hi> Eph. 1.11. <hi>Being predeÅ¿tinate according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e of him who worketh all things according to the counÅ¿ell of his own will.</hi> See allÅ¿o <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. and 2.47. <hi>John</hi> 10.14. and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They in theÅ¿e doctrines determine it to be an unjuÅ¿t thing in God to determine with himÅ¿elf before the world was, to <hi>make of the Å¿ame lump</hi> of his own clay, <hi>one veÅ¿Å¿el unto honour, and another unto diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi> one a <hi>veÅ¿Å¿el of wrath, &amp;c.</hi> and another a <hi>veÅ¿Å¿el of mercy,</hi> quite contradictory to the ApoÅ¿tles judgement, and to <hi>Davids</hi> allÅ¿o: <hi>What Å¿hall we Å¿ay then? Is there unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e with God? God forbid,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14. though yet he did acknowledge, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29921:22"/>God did even Å¿o, as <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And <hi>David</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his waies, and holy in all his works: Yea though it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that Å¿heweth mercy;</hi> and that <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> (yea even <hi>he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>) as <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 17, 18. and 15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It importeth, That God is as much engaged to Å¿hew mercy unto all, as to any at all; and Å¿o that God is unjuÅ¿t, if any be damned: As if there were no more cauÅ¿e nor reaÅ¿on in the Å¿ight of God wherefore it is that he Å¿aveth Å¿uch, and the very Å¿ame, who are his Elect, then if he Å¿hould Å¿ave the Reprobates: denying in effect, that there was any cauÅ¿e why he <hi>loved Jacob, and hated EÅ¿ay,</hi> whiles <hi>they had not done either good or evill;</hi> as if the one had then been as good and lovely in the Å¿ight of God, as was the other whom he had Å¿elected with his own hand from the very loyns of his naturall parents. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It importeth, That Å¿ome of Gods very Elect Å¿hall or may be damned; contrary to the ApoÅ¿tles judgement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from 28. to the end; where the ApoÅ¿tle concludes, That he <hi>was perÅ¿waded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preÅ¿ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, Å¿hall be able to Å¿eparate Å¿uch,</hi> who are his Elect, <hi>from the love of God which is in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It importeth, That Å¿ome <hi>of old ordained unto condemnation,</hi> and that <hi>are made</hi> (purpoÅ¿ely) <hi>for the day of evill,</hi> as <hi>veÅ¿Å¿els of wrath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for destruction;</hi> yea that <hi>like brute beaÅ¿ts are made to be taken and to be deÅ¿troyed,</hi> may yet poÅ¿Å¿ibly be Å¿aved; as if the purpoÅ¿e of God could poÅ¿Å¿ibly be fruÅ¿trate. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4, 5. <hi>Job</hi> 21.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 16, 17, 28, 19, &amp;c. and <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This doctrine importeth, That none are Gods Elect but Å¿uch who come to years of diÅ¿cretion, and Å¿o to faith and repentance; though they would pretend the contrary; as if all children, dying in Infancy, Å¿hould certainly be Å¿aved: Whereas the conÅ¿equence of their doctrine concludes them all damned: For they plainly aÅ¿Å¿ert in their fift par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wherein they diÅ¿Å¿ent from us,</p>
            <p>That <hi>the only decree of Election that can be aÅ¿Å¿erted from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is for Å¿ubÅ¿tance and effect, WhoÅ¿oever believeth Å¿hall be Å¿aved: As the only decree of Reprobation this, WhoÅ¿oever believeth not Å¿hall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:29921:23"/>
            <p n="8">8. It concludes it a thing neceÅ¿Å¿ary, for clearing the Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice of God, to make every particular perÅ¿on righteous, as <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, before it can Å¿tand with Infinite JuÅ¿tice and Mercy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for Å¿in.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It concludeth in effect, That it could not Å¿tand with the JuÅ¿tice and Mercy of God to determine with himÅ¿elf before he created the Angels, to Å¿uffer Å¿ome of them to fall, and after condemn them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaÅ¿ting torments for not keeping their firÅ¿t eÅ¿tate, as the Angels did; as is Å¿hewed in the book by neceÅ¿Å¿ary conÅ¿equence. See ReaÅ¿. 6. to the Å¿econd particular.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This their doctrine holdeth forth, That both Men and Angels, yea and even all <hi>the whole creation, are nothing elÅ¿e but God himÅ¿elf:</hi> Which is an aÅ¿perÅ¿ion blaÅ¿phemouÅ¿ly impious; as you may Å¿ee in the book, ReaÅ¿. 6. to the Å¿econd particular.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This doctrine importeth, That no man can be aÅ¿Å¿ured that he Å¿hall not periÅ¿h eternally, till the end of his life; for they build all their aÅ¿Å¿urance upon perÅ¿everance in the faith, and that to the end: As though men could not know that they have allready <hi>eternall life abiding in</hi> them, which cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly terminate or come to an end; being kept, not by their own power, but <hi>by the power of God, through faith unto Å¿alvation,</hi> as is at large proved in the book:</p>
            <p n="12">12. This doctrine teacheth expreÅ¿ly, That it were more wiÅ¿edome in God, for making them more religious, and more obedient to his will, to hold them in Å¿uÅ¿pence all their life long, and give them no aÅ¿Å¿ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</p>
            <p>Whereas the WiÅ¿edome and Mercy of God hath thought it better <hi>to give knowledge of Å¿alvation to his people, by the remÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿innes; that they might Å¿erve him, without fear, in holineÅ¿Å¿e and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e all the daies of their life,</hi> Luke 1.74, 75, 77, 78, 79. See allÅ¿o ReaÅ¿. 1. to the firÅ¿t particular.</p>
            <p n="13">13. This doctrine teacheth, That all children are alike holy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy in the Å¿ight of God by generation, and Å¿o till they come to years of diÅ¿cretion; and that not only Jewes <hi>by nature are the children of wrath as well as Gentiles, their father being an Amorite, and their mother an Hittite;</hi> and that <hi>all have Å¿inned,</hi> both Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and <hi>are</hi> therefore <hi>deprived of the glory of God,</hi> as Å¿o the text is clear.</p>
            <p>But all they Å¿ay <hi>are in a like condition by generation,</hi> whatever pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29921:23"/>they are Å¿prung from, which quite contradicteth the ApoÅ¿tles aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ertion, to wit, <hi>ElÅ¿e were your children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. See all their fourth ReaÅ¿on of their diÅ¿Å¿ent from us, in their third particular.</p>
            <p n="14">14. It concludeth expreÅ¿ly either manifeÅ¿t inconÅ¿iÅ¿tencies, or that the intent and purpoÅ¿e of God in his decree of Reprobation, is utterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate and diÅ¿appointed:</p>
            <p>For particular Å¿ixth they Å¿ay, <hi>The intent, at leaÅ¿t the primary or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent intent of God in his decree of Reprobation, is the Å¿alvation, not the condemnation of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. It quite perverteth the phraÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles, in diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ation of the doctrines of the GoÅ¿pell:</p>
            <p>For they Å¿ay, particular the fourth,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Faith and Repentance in particular perÅ¿ons are not the fruits and effects of Election: But Election rather the fruit of theÅ¿e:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if Election decreed before the foundation of the world, could be the fruit of Faith and Repentance: And further, let any rationall man but read the order of the doctrine in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Whom he predeÅ¿tinated them he called, &amp;c.</hi> Not whom he called, them he after predeÅ¿tinated, for that were clear impropriety of language; for it were not predeÅ¿tination at all, if it were not a determination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent unto calling, as here the Spirit of God renders it: And whether it be fitter to believe <hi>Paul</hi> or them, let themÅ¿elves judge.</p>
